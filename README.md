ds18b20
=======

Quite portable driver for the ds18b20 temperature sensor, including a function that actually calculates the crc (in case you have a system where you can't fit a 256 byte crc table)

Included is an example project for the STM32F4-DISCOVERY board. It doesn't do much but it shows how it works.
